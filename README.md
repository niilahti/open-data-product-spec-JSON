Features
------------

The Open Data Product Specification is a vendor-neutral, open-source machine-readable data product metadata model. It defines the objects and attributes as well as the structure of digital data products. The work is based on existing standards (schema.org), best practices and emerging concepts like Data Mesh. The reasoning is that we reuse and proudly copy instead of reinventing the wheel. More detailed information of the origin can be found from the [Open Data Product Specification homepage](https://www.dataproductbusiness.com/open-data-product-specification). 

Specification aims
------------

* enable interoperability between organizations, data platforms,  marketplaces, and tools. 
* reduce data product metadata conversions and errors between systems and organizations, 
* increase the speed of designing, testing, and implementing data products. 
* speed up tools development around data product design, development and management.
* enable creation of automated data product deployment with standard methods (DataOps)

**Note!** In the "Open Data Product" focus is on the latter words and the prefix 'open' refers to openness of the standard. Any kind of connotations to open data (different thing) are not intentional, intended or desirable.
