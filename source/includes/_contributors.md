# Editors and contributors

This specification is openly developed and a lot of the work comes from community. We list all community contributors as a sign of appreciation. The editors (as initial creators of the the specification) are Jarkko Moilanen and Jussi Niilahti. Editors take the feedback and draft new candidate releases, which may become the versions of the specification. 

## List of community contributors 

The work around the specification would not be possible without enormous help from the community. Here's list of contributors so far. 

* Toni Luhti
